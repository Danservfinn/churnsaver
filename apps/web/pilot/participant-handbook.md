## Optimization Strategies

### Channel Optimization

#### Push Notifications
**Best For**: Immediate awareness and urgency
**Performance**: 40-50% open rates
**Optimization Tips**:
- Use for immediate failures
- Keep messages under 100 characters
- Test different urgency levels

#### Direct Messages
**Best For**: Detailed recovery offers and links
**Performance**: 60-70% engagement rates
**Optimization Tips**:
- Include payment links
- Personalize with membership details
- Test message length and tone

### Incentive Optimization

#### Finding Your Sweet Spot
**Low Value ($5-20/month)**: 1-3 days free
**Medium Value ($20-100/month)**: 3-7 days free
**High Value ($100+/month)**: 7-14 days free

#### Testing Strategy
1. Start with 3 days for 2 weeks
2. Test 7 days for 1 week
3. Test 1 day for 1 week
4. Analyze results and optimize

### Timing Optimization

#### Standard Schedule: T+0, T+2, T+4
- **T+0**: Immediate (creates urgency)
- **T+2**: Follow-up (good engagement window)
- **T+4**: Final attempt (before giving up)

#### Custom Schedules
- **Aggressive**: T+0, T+1, T+3 (for high-value memberships)
- **Conservative**: T+0, T+4, T+7 (for low-engagement audiences)
- **Minimal**: T+0 only (testing or low volume)

## Advanced Techniques

### A/B Testing Framework

#### Setting Up Tests
1. Define hypothesis: "7 days free recovers 30% more than 3 days"
2. Split traffic: 50/50 between variations
3. Run for 2 weeks minimum
4. Analyze results with statistical significance

#### Common Test Variables
- Incentive amounts (1, 3, 7, 14 days)
- Reminder timing (T+0/T+2/T+4 vs T+0/T+4/T+7)
- Channel mix (push only vs push + DM)
- Message tone (urgent vs friendly)

### Audience Segmentation

#### By Membership Value
