### Welcome to Churn Saver!

Hi [Creator Name],

Congratulations! You've just installed the most effective payment recovery system for Whop creators. Churn Saver has already started monitoring your payments and will automatically recover failed subscriptions.

### Quick Setup (5 minutes)

We've pre-configured Churn Saver with optimal settings, but let's customize it for your audience:

#### 1. Configure Communication Channels
Visit your [Churn Saver Dashboard](https://your-app.whop.com/apps/churn-saver) and enable:
- ✅ Push notifications (40-50% open rate)
- ✅ Direct messages (60-70% engagement)

#### 2. Set Your Recovery Incentives
Choose how many free days to offer on first failure:
- **Recommended**: 3 days free
- **High-value memberships**: 7 days free
- **Test first**: 1 day free

#### 3. Schedule Reminder Timing
Select when to follow up:
- ✅ T+0: Immediate notification
- ✅ T+2: 2-day follow-up
- ✅ T+4: Final attempt

### Test Your Setup

Create a test payment failure to see Churn Saver in action:
1. Make a small test purchase ($1)
2. Cancel the payment to trigger failure
3. Watch the dashboard update automatically

### What to Expect

**First 24 hours**: 20-40% of test failures recover automatically
**First week**: 15-25% recovery rate on real failures
**First month**: 25-35% optimized recovery rate
