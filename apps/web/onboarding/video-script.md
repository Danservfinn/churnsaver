Communication channels - enable push notifications and direct messages. We recommend both for maximum recovery rates.

Recovery incentives - choose how many free days to offer on first failure. Three days is our recommended starting point.

## Video 3: Optimization Strategies (4:15)

**Narrator**: "Setting up Churn Saver is just the beginning. The real power comes from continuous optimization. Let's explore proven strategies to maximize your recovery rates."

### Channel Optimization (0:20-1:00)
[Visual: Push vs DM comparison charts]

**Narrator**: "Different communication channels have different effectiveness rates. Push notifications typically see 40-50% open rates but work best for urgent messages.

Direct messages achieve 60-70% engagement and are perfect for detailed recovery offers with payment links.

Our recommendation: use both channels. Push for immediate awareness, DM for conversion."

### Incentive Optimization (1:00-1:45)
[Visual: Incentive amount vs recovery rate chart]

**Narrator**: "Incentives are powerful but expensive. Find the sweet spot:

1-day free: Good for testing, minimal cost.
3-day free: Our recommended starting point.
7-day free: Better for high-value memberships.
14+ days: Only for premium subscriptions.

Track cost vs recovery rate. Your incentive should pay for itself through recovered revenue."

### Timing Optimization (1:45-2:30)
[Visual: Recovery rate by day chart]

**Narrator**: "Timing is everything in payment recovery:

T+0 (immediate): Creates urgency, highest response rate.
T+2 days: Good follow-up window.
T+4 days: Final attempt before giving up.

Most recoveries happen within 48 hours. Don't wait too long, but give users time to respond."

### A/B Testing Framework (2:30-3:15)
[Visual: Split testing interface mockup]

**Narrator**: "Use data-driven optimization with A/B testing:

Test different incentive amounts with similar memberships.
Try different message timings.
Experiment with channel combinations.

Split your recovery cases and measure which variations perform better."

### Advanced Analytics (3:15-3:45)
[Visual: Advanced dashboard features]

**Narrator**: "Go beyond basic metrics:

Recovery velocity - how quickly payments are recovered.
Channel attribution - which channels drive the most recoveries.
Membership tier analysis - optimize per price point.
Seasonal patterns - adjust for peak/off-peak periods."

### Common Mistakes (3:45-4:00)
[Visual: Warning signs, fixes]

**Narrator**: "Avoid these common optimization mistakes:

Over-incentivizing - free days that don't pay for themselves.
Over-messaging - spam that annoys users.
Ignoring data - not adjusting based on results.
No testing - sticking with default settings forever."

### Closing (4:00-4:15)
[Visual: Success metrics, growth chart]
